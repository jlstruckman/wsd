			<h2>Welcome to Ratz Need Love!</h2>

			<p id="col">This site is an information portal for people who either own rats as a pet or are interested in learning more about them.
			Throughout the years, rats have gained quite the negative reputation. The goal of this site is to show people that rats are lovable, friendly creatures that deserve just as much respect as a standard house pet. 
			If you would like to receive information on adoptable rattie friends or would just like to be added to our mailing list, please check out the "Sign Up" page for more information. We love to see new faces in the community!</p>
